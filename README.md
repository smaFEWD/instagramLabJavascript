- In this app we will be practicing the concepts of oAuth combined with templating JSON data.
- Download the starter code here and use it as your front end for the application.
- Your goal is to use the Instagram API to pull images around your current location and display them on the page.
- You will need to create a developer account and register a new client here: [https://www.instagram.com/developer/](https://www.instagram.com/developer/)
- You will want to check out the [media search endpoint](https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/#get_media_search) to built this functionality.
- You will also need to get the user's location via HTML5 geolocation. More information on how to do that can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation).
- **Bonus:** When the user successfully logs in with Instagram, change the "Login with Instagram" button to text that says "Welcome {name}!".
